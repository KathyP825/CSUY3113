In our code:
-   mat4 = create a 4x4 matrix

Why do we need mat4?
-   everything is really 3D
-   we need Homogenous Coordinates to transform a 3D vector
    ___   ___                ___   ___
    |   X   |                |   X   |
    |   Y   |    ------->    |   Y   |
    |__ Z __|                |   Z   |
                             |__ 1 __|

-   we are always using 3D vectors
    -   when we want to translate it, need to take 3D vectors and turn them into 4D
    -   then apply the 4x4 matricies

-   everything in OpenGL is in 3D
