On your own GitHub:
1.  Go to "Your repositories" tab
2.  Click "New" button (should be green & had picture of a closed book)
3.  Enter name for new repository
4.  Click "Create repository" button (should be green), ignore all other settings

Connecting Repo w/ Folder in Computer (Windows):
1. Use Command Prompt (not Windows Powershell)
2. Copy the instructions on the new repository for connecting
    - make sure there are no "quotations marks" around the message on ECHO command line
        - this is to make sure the words in the README.md will be bold and not "# CSUY3113"
    - Command Prompt might ask for login email and username
