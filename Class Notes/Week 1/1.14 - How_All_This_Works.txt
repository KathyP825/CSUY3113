How does this all work?
-   Triangles (a lot of them)
    -   3D models are made using triangles
        -   more curved = smaller and more triangles
-   Textures
    -   adds the details to the triangles
    -   2D images (can be made in any art program)
    -   parts of textures are mapped to the triangles
    -   Texture Coordinates = where on the texture is info being pulled from to draw on the triangle
-   Hardware Rendering
    -   loading textures onto Graphics Card
    -   tells Graphics Card what to draw
