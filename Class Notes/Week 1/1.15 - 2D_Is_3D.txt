More on Triangles:
-   sending very simple models with 2 triangles
-   each triangle has 3 verticies & each point is a vertex
-   triangles are 1 sided
    -   the side is determined by the order of the verticies
        -   clockwise = back-facing
        -   counter-clockwise = front-facing

Texture Coordinates:
-   top left corner = (0, 0)
-   top right corner = (1, 0)
-   bottom left corner = (0, 1)
-   bottom right corner = (1, 1)
-   coordinates are from 0 to 1 regardless of resolution of the image (ex. 256x256 pixels or 1024x1024 pixels)

Model Coordinates
-   origin = center = (0, 0)
-   top left corner = (-1, 1)
-   top right corner = (1, 1)
-   bottom left corner = (-1, -1)
-   bottom right corner = (1, -1)

Shaders
-   Vertex Shader
    -   translates verticies to screen positions
    -   translates and maps the data
-   Fragment Shader
    -   determines what color to draw for each triangle
    -   when it goes to fill a triangle, for each pixel, determines what color to draw
    -   can pull the data from the texture or a solid color
