Texture Filtering
-   original = original size of image
-   minification
    -   when something is scaled down
    -   can also be caused by the resolution
-   magnification
    -   when something is made bigger
    -   needs to fill in some information
-   2 settings:
    -   need to try both to figure out which is best for your project
    1.  linear
        -   good for high resolution textures (or pics of real things) & textures without anti-aliasing
    2.  nearest neighbor
        -   good for pixel art
        -   will most likely use this setting for the projects in this course

-----------------

Texture Filtering Settings
-   use GL_LINEAR or GL_NEAREST
-   MIN = minifying, MAG = magnifying
-   Code:
        glTexParameter(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, GL_NEAREST);   // minimize
        glTexParameter(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER, GL_NEAREST);   // magnify
