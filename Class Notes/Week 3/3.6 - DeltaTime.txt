-   is how different frame rates are handled on different computers
-   will make it appear as if both computers are running at the same speed
    -   frame rate is not slower
    -   it just makes it look slower so things can happen at the same time
-   DeltaTime = amount of time that has passed since the last frame
-   is used to do math in the current frame

-   ex. DeltaTime values on different computers:
            60 FPS: 16.66 ms  /  1000  = 0.0166
                deltaTime = 0.0166
            30 FPS: 33.33 ms  /  1000  = 0.0333
                deltaTime = 0.0333

            // travel 1 unit per second
            player_x += 0.1f * deltaTime;

-   can use timing to handle rotation as well
-   ex.     // rotate 45 degrees per second
            rotate_z += 45.0f * deltaTime;
            modelMatrix = glm::rotate(modelMatrix, glm::radians(rotate_z), glm::vec3(0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f));
