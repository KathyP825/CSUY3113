Model Space
-   each model has its own local origin (0, 0)

World Space
-   placing models in World Space
-   the game world has its own origin (0, 0)

------

Problem:
-   need to transform from Model Space to World Space
-   need to place model character in one location & place sword object in another location
    -   Code ex.
        playerMatrix = glm::mat4(1.0f);      // start off with Identity Matrix
        playerMatrix = glm::translate(playerMatrix, glm::vec3(1.0f, 2.0f, 0.0f));

        swordMatrix = glm::mat4(1.0f);      // start off with Identity Matrix
        swordMatrix = glm::translate(swordMatrix, glm::vec3(7.0f, 2.0f, 0.0f));

Hierarchy
-   may need to make a hierarchy if something is relative to another object
    -   ex. player has picked up the sword

        playerMatrix = glm::mat4(1.0f);      // start off with Identity Matrix
        playerMatrix = glm::translate(playerMatrix, glm::vec3(1.0f, 2.0f, 0.0f));

        swordMatrix = glm::translate(playerMatrix, glm::vec3(7.0f, 2.0f, 0.0f));    // makes sword relative to player
        swordMatrix = glm::rotate(swordMatrix, 0.78f, glm::vec3(0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f)); // rotate sword to make it look like player is holding it
