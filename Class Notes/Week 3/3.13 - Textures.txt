Loading and Preparing Textures/Images
-   buildings, people, spaceship, etc. = textures
-   applying the textures onto the polygons
-   need to load and prepare the textures/images
    -   this is done during the setup, not every frame

OpenGL Textures
-   loading an image off our drive into our RAM, then gives Video Card the image
-   Video Card gives back an ID number
-   use ID number to refer to the texture when drawing
