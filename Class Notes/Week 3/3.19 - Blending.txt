-   the textures will have transparency to them
-   might have things that are semi-transparent
-   need to tell OpenGL how to deal with it

Blending
-   is OFF by default, need to enable it so the images are transparent
    -   this is done in Initialization

-   Code:
        glEnable(GL_BLEND);
        glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA);  // good setting for transparency
