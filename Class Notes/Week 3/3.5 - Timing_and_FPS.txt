-   FPS = Frames Per Second
-   things should happen at the same speed in the games regardless of how fast / slow the user's hardware is

Problem:
-   faster hardware does more updates than slower hardware
-   ex.
        void Update() {
            player_x += 0.1f;   // if computer runs at 60fps, this addition happens 60 times in 1 second
                                // if computer runs at 30fps, this addition happens 30 times in 1 second
        }
        void Render() {
            playerMatrix = glm::mat4(1.0f);
            playerMatrix = glm::translate(playerMatrix, glm::vec3(player_x, player_y, 0.0f));
        }

-   need to accomodate for this problem
-   Answer: Delta time
