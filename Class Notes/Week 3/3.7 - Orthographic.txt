May have noticed:
    projectionlMatrix = glm::ortho(-5.0f, 5.0f, -3.75f, 3.75f, -1.0f, 1.0f);
    program.setProjectionMatrix(projectionlMatrix);

Perspective view VS Orthographic view
-   perspective view = as things get further away, they get smaller
    -   things appear to be getting to a point
-   orthographic view
    -   will be used in the 2D games in this course
    -   is more of a box
    -   everything appears to be the same size even though they might be further away

Back to the code:
                             these numbers means how much of the world we can see
                                                      |
                                     _________________|_________________
                                     |     |      |      |       |     |
    projectionlMatrix = glm::ortho(-5.0f, 5.0f, -3.75f, 3.75f, -1.0f, 1.0f);    // -5 to the left
                                                                                // 5 to the right
                                                                                // -3.75 to the bottom
                                                                                // 3.75 to the top
                                                                                // result = 10 units across, 7.5 units up
    program.setProjectionMatrix(projectionlMatrix);

-   reason for these numbers is because of window resolution ratio
-   need to have the same ratio or else things will look weird
        Window Resolution: 640 / 480 = 1.3333
        Orthographic View: 10 / 7.5 = 1.3333

-   can change the window size but will need to change the orthographic numbers
-   if doubled the numbers = pulled away from the world, able to see more
-   if made the numbers smaller = close to the world, wouldn't be able to see as much of the world
