-   games are not static scenes
-   things need to translate, rotate, and scale over time

------------

How to Implement:
-   can initialize Model Matrix and change the matrix every frame (can get weird)
    -   keep updating the same matrix
        -   might cause errors since it's being done multiple times per second
    
    void Initialize() {
        playerMatrix = glm::mat4(1.0f);
    }
    void Update() {
        playerMatrix = glm::translate(playerMatrix, glm::vec3(0.1f, 0.0f, 0.0f));
    }

    -   should not do it this way

------------

Better way to implement:
-   keep track of position, rotation, and scale using variables
-   set up matrix as needed

    void Initialize() {
        player_x = 0.0f;
        player_y = 0.0f;
    }
    void Update() {
        playerMatrix = glm::mat4(1.0f);
        playerMatrix = glm::translate(playerMatrix, glm::vec3(player_x, player_y, 0.0f));
    }
