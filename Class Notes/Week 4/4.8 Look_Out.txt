-   Joysticks are in a circle
-   WASD keys make a square
-   Pythagorean Theorem:    A^2 + B^2 = C^2

-   pressing D movement vector = [1, 0]
    -   move to the right
    -   What is the magnitude / length of that?
        -   Answer: 1

-   pressing D movement vector = [0, 1]
    -   move up
    -   What is the magnitude / length of that?
        -   Answer: 1

-   pressing W and D movement vector at the same time = [1, 1]
    -   move up and right at the same time
    -   What is the magnitude / length of that?
        -   Answer: 1.414

Unit Vector
-   a vector with a magnitude of 1
-   can use a Unit Circle to find the units
    -   everything on the perimeter has a magnitude of 1
-   if hold down W and D on keyboard, vector is [1,1]
-   if joystick is put into the same corner, value is [0.707, 0.707]
-   need to normalize the value so the unit can't be moved more than 1 based on what key is pressed

-   normalize a vector to get the unit vector
    -   divide a vector by its magnitude
    -   there is a glm::normalize function
        -   don't use if magnitude = 0

--------

How do we code that?

// check if length of how much we're trying to move is greater than 1
// if yes, normalize
if (glm::length(player_movement) > 1.0f) {
    player_movement = glm::normalize(player_movement);
}
