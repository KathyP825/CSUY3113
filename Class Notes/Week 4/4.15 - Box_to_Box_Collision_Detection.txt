------------------------------

-   most common type of collision detection
-   will be using this the most in this class

-   Legend of Zelda
    -   is made out of tiles, which are all boxes
    -   there is a lot of detecting if Link is touching one of the tiles
        -   check if he can walk over it / past it
        -   check if he collides with a door, then enters a different space
        -   box around the enemy, touching one of these boxes = lose some health

-   hit box = the area the player / enemy sends attack from
    -   the box area that can do damage
