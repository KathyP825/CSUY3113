------------------------------------

-   one of the easier collision detections to calculate
-   have 2 circles
    -   want to see if they are colliding / intersecting
    -   are located on the world somewhere (think on a grid)
    -   have a center to each of them
    -   are usually described by their center and radius

    -   ex1.
            Circle 1:                       Circle 2:
                Radius1 = 3                     Radius2 = 2
                P1 = -2, -2                     P2 = 3, 3

            Radius1 + Radius2 = 5
            Distance (from the centers) = 7.07 (by Pythagorean Theorem)

            distance > (radius + radius)
            -   not intersecting

    -   ex2.
            Circle 1:                       Circle 2:
                Radius1 = 3                     Radius2 = 2
                P1 = 0, 0                       P2 = 3, 3

            Radius1 + Radius2 = 5
            Distance (from the centers) = 4.24 (by Pythagorean Theorem)

            distance < (radius + radius)
            -   are intersecting

-   circles are colliding if the distance between the center of the circle is less than the sum of the radii
