SDL_GetKeyboardState
-   returns a pointer to an array of key states
    -   gets current state of all keys
    -   pointer returned is a pointer to an internal SDL array
        -   is valid for the whole lifetime of the application
        -   should not be freed by the caller
-   value of 1 = key is pressed
-   value of 0 = key is not pressed
-   uses SDL_Scancode to obtain the indexes for the array
-   when SDL initializes, it creates an array and puts the key values in there
    -   should not free that memory

-   Code:
        const Uint8 *keys = SDL_GetKeyboardState(NULL);     // gets the pointer
        if (keys[SDL_SCANCODE_LEFT]) {      // if left key is down right now
            PlayerLeft();
        }

        if SDL_SCANCODE_RIGHT]() {
            PlayerRight();
        }
        // notice it's SDLSCANCODE_ and not SDLK_
