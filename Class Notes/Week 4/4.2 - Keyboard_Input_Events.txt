-   keyboard input = most common thing that will be added to our games
    -   use to move our character around and make them do stuff

---------------------

Original Game Loop Code:
    
Startup();
while (gameIsRunning) {
    ProcessInput();
    Update();
    Render();
}
Shutdown();

---------------------

Original ProcessInput(); Code:

SDL_Event event;
while (SDL_PollEvent(&event)) {     // looking for events
    if (event.type == SDL_QUIT || event.type == SDL_WINDOWEVENT_CLOSE) {    // looking for quit / window close events
        gameIsRunning = False;
    }
}

---------------------

Some Updated ProcessInput();

-   use a switch / case for event types
    -   Code:
            switch (event.type) {     // looking for events
                case SDL_QUIT:
                case SDL_WINDOWEVENT_CLOSE:
                    gameIsRunning = false;
                    break;
            }


-   key is pressed = SDL_KEYDOWN
-   key released = SDL_KEYUP

-   need to check if a key is pressed
    -   Code:
            // checks if there is a key pressed
            case SDL_KEYDOWN:
                switch (event.key.keysym.sym) {
                    // ........
                }
                break;


-   need to check which key is being pressed
    -   list of SDL keyboard scancode & corresponding keys: https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_Scancode
    -   Code:
            // checks which key is pressed
            switch (event.key.keysym.sym) {
                case SDLK_RIGHT:
                    player_x += 1;
                    break;

                case SDLK_SPACE:
                    PlayerJump();
                    break;
            }
            
---------------------

ProcessInput(); After Edits Code:

void ProcessInput() {
    SDL_Event event;
    while (SDL_PollEvent(&event)) {     // while there are events to process
        switch (event.type) {   // checks types of events 
            case SDL_QUIT:
            case SDL_WINDOWEVENT_CLOSE:
                gameIsRunning = false;
                break;

            case SDL_KEYDOWN:
                switch (event.key.keysym.sym) {
                    case SDLK_LEFT:
                        // Move the player left
                        break;
                    
                    case SDLK_RIGHT:
                        // Move the player right
                        break;
                    
                    case SDLK_SPACE:
                        // Some sort of action
                        break;
                }
                break; // SDL_KEYDOWN
        }
    }
}

---------------------

SDL_KEYDOWN and SDL_KEYUP
-   great for knowing when a key is pressed or released
-   useful for actions such as jumping or shooting
-   but need something else for when a key is held down (long press)
