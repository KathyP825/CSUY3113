SDL_MOUSEMOTION
-   happens when mouse is moved
-   if mouse is stationary, won't get triggered
-   Code:
        case SDL_MOUSEMOTION:
            //event.motion.x        // x-position in pixels
            //event.motion.y        // y-position in pixels
            break;

SDL_MOUSEBUTTONDOWN
-   this is when someone clicks the mouse button
-   gets the x & y of where the mouse was click inside the window
-   gets which button was clicked (button 1, 2, or 3)

-   Code:
        case SDL_MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:
            //event.button.x        // x-position in pixels
            //event.button.y        // y-position in pixels
            //event.button.button   // button that was clicked (1,2,3)
            break;

Polling the Mouse
-   see where mouse is currently at / current position
-   is different from an event
-   is outside of the while loop
-   keyboard polling is also outside of the while loop
-   the coordinates are in the window that was made (not real life coordinates)
-   Code:
        // put this outside of "while (SDL_PollEvent(&event))"
        int x, y;
        SDL_GetMouseState(&x, &y);
