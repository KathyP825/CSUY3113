-   when collide with something, want to know where the collide

-   if player's bottom collide with enemy's top, that's okay
-   if player's left/right collides with enemy, that's not okay

-   if enemy collides with wall, make them move in a different direction

-   if player collides with block above them, can break the block
-   if player collides with block below them, can only stand on block

-   player should only be able to jump when touching the ground
    -   when have collision below player, it's okay to jump
    -   can't jump in midair

Code (Entity.h):

class Entity {
public:
    bool collidedTop;
    bool collidedBottom;
    bool collidedLeft;
    bool collidedRight;
};

-   also need to add in places where collisions occur
