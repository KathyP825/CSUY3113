-   acceleration due to gravity = 9.81 m/s^2

-------

Add to Entities:
-   variable for acceleration
-   set to -9.81
    -   acceleration is always moving down

-   Code:
        player.acceleration = glm::vec3(0, -9.81f, 0);

-------

Acceleration
-   rate of change of velocity
-   need to update acceleration first before updating velocity

-   Code:
        velocity.x += acceleration.x * elapsed;
        velocity.y += acceleration.y * elapsed;
        
        velocity += acceleration * elapsed; // You can also do this

-------

Velocity
-   change of position over time
-   position of player is updated based on their velocity
-   velocity is updated based on their acceleration

-   Code:
        position.x += velocity.x * elapsed;
        position.y += velocity.y * elapsed;
        
        position += velocity * elapsed; // You can also do this

-------

Putting it all together:
-   if acceleration never changes, velocity will keep accumulating 
-   update velocity based on our acceleration over time
-   update position based on our velocity over time

-   Code (pseudocode):
        player.acceleration = glm::vec3(0, -9.81f, 0);

        void Update(float deltaTime) { // playerâ€™s update
            velocity += acceleration * deltaTime;
            position += velocity * deltaTime;
        }
