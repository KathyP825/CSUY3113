Problem
-   currently getting stuck inside of platform and can't move left/right

Solution
-   check for overlap
-   fix the little bit that gets inside of platform before Rendering

------------

Check for Overlap Code:

// find how much was penetrated in the Y-direction
float ydist = fabs(position.y - other->position.y);
float penetrationY = fabs(ydist - height / 2 - other->height / 2);

------------

Updated Code for Update() :

void Entity::Update(float deltaTime, Entity *platforms, int platformCount) {
    velocity += acceleration * deltaTime;
    position += velocity * deltaTime;

    for (int i = 0; i < platformCount; i++) {
        Entity *platform = &platforms[i];

        // if collide with something
        if (CheckCollision(platform)) {
            float ydist = fabs(position.y - platform->position.y);      // get distance from centers
            float penetrationY = fabs(ydist - (height / 2.0f) - (platform->height / 2.0f));     // how too far we went
        
            if (velocity.y > 0) {   // if going up and hit a platform, move self down
                position.y -= penetrationY;
                velocity.y = 0;
            } else if (velocity.y < 0) {
                position.y += penetrationY;     // if falling down and hit a platform, move self up
                velocity.y = 0;
            }
        }
    }
}
