-   We will work with evenly spaced texture atlases
    -   each tile has to take the same amount of space in the grid
    -   can't clutter the images together

-   imagine as putting images inside a grid with one image per grid
    -   helps with getting the texture coordinates needed

-   check video / powerpoint slides for examples
