-   our animations will be a flipbook style
    -   have individual frames and swapping the frames that we're drawing

-   To create an animation:
    -   define indicies used for animation on the sprite sheet / texture atlas
        -   keep textures in the sequence you want them to appear (makes it easier to work with)
    -   have a timer
    -   go to next frame when time hits its value
    -   if last frame finished, go back to first frame (aka looping)

-   ex. george_0.png , walk to the right
    -   indicies of animation: (3, 7, 11, 15)
        -   in this case, textures are not in sequence
            -   need to find their indicies
    -   timer
        -   if drawing 60 frames a second, don't want to flip the animation 60 times a second
        -   probably need to draw a frame and leave it there
            -   go to the next frame after waiting a little bit
        -   even if game is drawing at 60 frames a second, don't want to animate at 60 frames a second
            -   might want 4 frames a second

How to Code:

// Inside of Initialization
playerTextureID = LoadTexture("george_0.png");
cols = 4;
rows = 4;
animIndices = new int[4] {3, 7, 11, 15};        // list of indicies of the sprites we need
animFrames = 4;     // 4 frames
animIndex = 0;      // index for which sprite on animIndices[] is being used

// Inside of Update
animTime += deltaTime;
if (animTime >= 0.25f) {        // when reach 1/4 of a second
    animTime = 0.0f;
    animIndex++;
    if (animIndex >= animFrames) {      // checks if at last, does the looping
        animIndex = 0;
    }
}

// Inside of Render
DrawSpriteFromTextureAtlas(&program, playerTextureID, animIndices[animIndex]);
                                                            ^
                                                            |
                                                    index of sprite
