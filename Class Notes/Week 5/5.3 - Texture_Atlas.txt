Texture Atlas
-   one texture that has a lot of sprites on it
    -   one image that has all of the individual sprites on it that we would need in our games
-   instead of loading each image individually (a lot of code), just load one image
-   pick out the pieces you need from it for your game
-   character textures / moving objects

----------------------------------------------------

Tileset
-   a set of tiles used to build levels / map of our game
    -   background images design
    -   level item drops
-   is one image

How to pull out tiles in a Tileset
-   use the texture coordinates to get the single tile out of the tileset
-   can apply the pulled out tile to the triangles in the game

----------------------------------------------------

Fonts
-   is an image of the letters in a font
-   has all of the letters and characters that might be needed for the game
-   can take out the letters to be used as User Interface in the game
